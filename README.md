# Ola Data Analysis Using Power BI

This project involves the analysis of an Ola dataset to uncover insights into ride trends, customer behavior, and operational performance. Using Power BI, we built interactive dashboards to visualize key metrics and support data-driven decision-making.

---

## Project Objectives

- Analyze ride frequency, peak hours, and revenue patterns.
- Understand customer demographics and their impact on ride preferences.
- Explore city-wise and time-specific trends.
- Highlight key operational metrics like trip duration and driver efficiency.

## Features

### 1. Data Cleaning and Transformation
- Cleaned and preprocessed raw data using **Power Query**.
- Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized data formats.

### 2. Interactive Dashboards
- Created user-friendly dashboards with visualizations such as:
  - **Bar Charts**: Rides per city and time of day.
  - **Line Graphs**: Revenue trends over time.
  - **Pie Charts**: Customer segmentation by demographics.
  - **Heat Maps**: Peak ride hours.

### 3. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Ride Metrics**: Total rides, average trip duration, and distance.
- **Revenue Metrics**: Total revenue, average fare per ride, and fare trends.
- **Customer Insights**: Breakdown of user activity by gender, age, and location.

## Key Insights

1. **Ride Trends**:
   - Peak ride hours are between 8 AM to 10 AM and 6 PM to 8 PM.
   - Weekdays witness higher ride volumes compared to weekends.

2. **Revenue Patterns**:
   - Significant revenue contribution from corporate customers.
   - Evening hours generate the highest revenue.

3. **City-Specific Analysis**:
   - Metro cities show a higher frequency of short-distance rides.
   - Suburban areas have a greater share of long-distance rides.

4. **Customer Behavior**:
   - Younger demographics (18-35) dominate ride usage.
   - Discounts and offers drive higher ride bookings during festive seasons.
